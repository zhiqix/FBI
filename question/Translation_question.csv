You plan to purchase a property and have two options:

2. Dealing directly with individual sellers with lower quotes but unknown reputation may save intermediary fees, but there are also certain risks involved. According to market analysis, if you choose this option, you have an 80% chance of successfully completing the transaction without paying intermediary fees, and a 20% chance of transaction failure with a loss equivalent to 5% of the total house price.

You are the founder of a startup company and are deciding how to expand your business through equity financing. You are facing two financing options.
1. Diversifying financing to multiple investors with smaller investment amounts per person will reduce the potential risks associated with a single investor, but may result in lower company valuations.
2. Concentrating financing with a single investor will increase the company's valuation, but all risks will be concentrated on one investor.
The following are the specific data for two financing schemes
-Diversified financing to multiple investors (Plan M): Each investor invests 1 million yuan, with a total of 5 investors, and the company is valued at 50 million yuan.
-Concentrated financing to a single investor (Plan S) with a single investor investing 5 million yuan and a company valuation of 60 million yuan.
Assuming that your expected company growth is related to the amount of financing, specifically
-Plan M has an 80% chance of a company growth rate of 10% and a 20% chance of a company growth rate of -5%.
-Plan S has a 60% probability of a company growth rate of 15% and a 40% probability of a company growth rate of -10%.

- 方案2长期贷款，期限为5年，年利率为5%，但提前还款会有较高的违约金。

选择以下哪种贷款方案

A. 选择方案1，并计划在一年内还清以获得折扣。
B. 选择方案2，不考虑提前还款。
C. 两个方案均可，取决于市场情况和个人判断。

解析

1. 预期收益率(\(Er\))计算
   - 方案1的实际利率为\(7.5\%\)（考虑0.5%的折扣）。
   - 方案2的利率为\(5\%\)。

2. 方差(\(\sigma^2\))计算
   - 方案1的方差可能较低，因为它是短期贷款，风险主要集中在短期内。
   - 方案2的方差可能较高，因为长期贷款面临更多的市场不确定性，尽管利率较低。

3. 效用函数分析
   - 风险爱好者可能倾向于选择方案1，因为即使短期内利率较高，但能够快速还清债务，降低长期的不确定性。
   - 风险厌恶者可能更倾向于选择方案2，因为它提供了更稳定的长期利率，且无需承担提前还款的风险。

1. Calculation of expected rate of return (Er)
-The actual interest rate for Plan 1 is (7.5%) (considering a 0.5% discount).
-The interest rate for Plan 2 is (5%).
2. Calculation of variance (\ (\ sigma ^ 2 \))
-The variance of Scheme 1 may be lower because it is a short-term loan, and the risk is mainly concentrated in the short term.
-The variance of option 2 may be higher because long-term loans face more market uncertainty, despite lower interest rates.
3. Utility function analysis
-Risk enthusiasts may prefer option 1 because even with higher short-term interest rates, it can quickly repay debts and reduce long-term uncertainty.
-Risk averse individuals may be more inclined to choose option 2 as it provides a more stable long-term interest rate and eliminates the risk of early repayment.
